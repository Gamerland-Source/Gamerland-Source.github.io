Gamerland: Source is a unique Team Fortress 2 gaming community that has gone through a lot of changes in the past few years. However, despite this, we are here to stay for as long as this cruel, technological world will let us.


We are a wacky TF2 server with a wide range of plugins such as 'bunnyhop', 'RTD', 'friendly', and many more! We're more than happy to welcome you to our community if you wish to join!
